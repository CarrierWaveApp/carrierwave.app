The Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your logging activity, streaks, propagation conditions, and service status.

## Activity Grid

A GitHub-style activity visualization appears at the top of the Dashboard, showing 26-52 weeks of history depending on screen width (full year on iPad or landscape orientation).

Each cell represents one day:

- **Green** - Day with {{< term "activation" >}} contacts
- **Blue** - Day with {{< term "Activity Log" >}} entries
- **Diagonal split** - Day with both activations and activity log entries
- **Gray** - No activity

Tap any cell to view contacts and activity for that day.

## Configurable Metrics Card

Choose 1-2 key metrics to display on your dashboard card. Configure the displayed metrics in Settings -> Dashboard Metrics.

- **Key/mic usage** for CW and voice modes

Tap the card to drill down into equipment-specific QSO lists. This helps you track which gear gets the most use and correlate equipment with operating performance.

## Friends on Air

The Friends on Air card surfaces real-time spot data for your accepted friends:

- **Active friends** currently spotted on POTA or RBN
- **Frequency, mode, and park reference** for each friend
- **Tap to tune** - opens the Logger pre-filled with the friend's frequency

This card only appears when you have friends configured and at least one is currently active.

### Friend Activity Feed

Below the Friends on Air card, a compact activity feed shows recent notable achievements from your friends (new DXCC, activations completed, streak milestones). Tap any entry to view the friend's profile.

## Smart Spot Needs Dashboard

The Needs dashboard card shows a summary of currently active spots that match your configured need categories:

- **Count of matching spots** across all need categories
- **Top needs** showing the most relevant spots (new DXCC, WAS, POTA parks)
- **Tap to expand** into the full [Smart Spot Needs](/reference/smart-needs/) view

Configure need categories in Settings -> Smart Needs or see the dedicated [Smart Spot Needs](/reference/smart-needs/) page.

## POTA Awards Progress

Track your progress toward POTA awards directly from the Dashboard:

- **Activator awards** (Bronze: 10 parks, Silver: 50, Gold: 100, Platinum: 250, Sapphire: 500)
- **Hunter awards** based on unique parks worked
- **Progress bar** showing how close you are to the next tier

- Error details (if applicable)

Supported services: {{< term "QRZ.com" >}}, {{< term "POTA" >}}, {{< term "LoFi" >}}, {{< term "LoTW" >}}, {{< term "HAMRS" >}}, {{< term "Club Log" >}}, eQSL

## Sync Reports

Per-service sync reports visualize the sync process as a funnel:

1. **Fetched** - Records downloaded from service
2. **Validated** - Records passing validation
3. **Changes Applied** - New or updated records imported
4. **Uploaded** - Local records sent to service

Each phase displays:

- Status badges (success, warning, error)
- Record counts
- Reconciliation details

Sync reports persist across app launches.

## Background Computation

Statistics are computed on a background thread to keep the app responsive:

1. Cached statistics display immediately on opening the Dashboard
2. A background task recomputes current totals
3. Display updates when computation completes

For large logs (thousands of {{< term "QSO" >}}s), a progress bar appears during recomputation.

## Pull to Refresh

Pull down on the Dashboard to trigger:

- Statistics recomputation
- Sync check for all services

## iPad Layout

On iPad or in landscape orientation:

- **Statistics grid** - All six primary stats display in a single row
- **Activity grid** - Shows up to 52 weeks (full year)
