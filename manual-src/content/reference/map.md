The Map View displays your {{< term "QSO" >}} contacts on an interactive world map with markers, geodesic paths, overlays, and performance-optimized rendering.

## Overview

Map View provides visual insight into your operating patterns by showing:

- Contact locations with marker pins
- Geodesic arc paths from your station to contacted stations
- Distance and direction statistics
- Geographic coverage (states, {{< term "DXCC" >}} entities)
- Real-time session maps during active logging
- Park boundaries, summit pins, and grid square overlays

All map rendering respects your privacy settings and only displays contacts you've logged locally.

## QSO Map

The main map displays your logged contacts as markers on a world map.

### Contact Markers

Each marker represents a station you've contacted. The marker is placed at the station's location based on:

- {{< term "Grid Square" >}} coordinates (if logged)
- {{< term "QTH" >}} data from {{< term "QRZ" >}} lookup
- State/country geolocation (fallback)

Markers are color-coded and sized to indicate density in areas with many contacts.

### Geodesic Arcs

Lines connecting your station to each contacted station follow the great circle (shortest) path over Earth's surface. These arcs show:

- True bearing from your location
- Visual representation of propagation paths
- Distance coverage patterns

Arcs are semi-transparent to prevent clutter in densely-contacted areas.

### Performance Limit

To maintain smooth interaction on large logs, the map defaults to displaying **500 QSOs** maximum. This limit ensures:

- Fast rendering and panning
- Responsive zooming
- Low memory usage

**Show All Toggle:** Tap the "Show All" button to render your entire log on the map. On logs with thousands of contacts, rendering may take a few seconds. The app caches the result for subsequent loads.

## Azimuthal Map

The Azimuthal map provides an azimuthal equidistant projection centered on your station location, rendered using a high-performance Canvas renderer.

### Projection

- **Center point** - Your grid square (configurable)
- **Equidistant** - All distances from center are accurate and proportional
- **True bearing** - Directions from center to any point are correct
- **Canvas-rendered** - Uses Core Graphics for smooth 60fps rendering

### SNR Heatmap

When RBN spot data is available, the azimuthal map can display an SNR heatmap:

- **Color gradient** from blue (weak) through green (moderate) to red (strong)
- **Geographic overlay** showing signal strength by direction
- **Time-windowed** - Shows data from the last 10-30 minutes (configurable)
- **Band-filtered** - Heatmap updates when you change the band filter

### QSO Arcs

Geodesic arcs from your station to contacted stations are drawn as curves on the azimuthal projection:

- **Band-colored** arcs distinguish contacts on different bands
- **Opacity** indicates recency (newer contacts are more opaque)
- **Tap an arc** to see QSO details

### Antenna Patterns

Overlay your antenna's radiation pattern on the azimuthal map:

- **Directional patterns** show the main lobe and nulls
- **Pattern data** loaded from equipment profiles
- **Rotate** to match your antenna's actual bearing
- **Compare** propagation paths against antenna coverage

### Compass

A compass rose overlay shows cardinal directions from your station, helping orient the azimuthal projection to real-world bearings.

## Park Boundaries

### POTA Park Boundaries

POTA park boundaries are rendered as filled polygons on the map:

- **GeoJSON source** - Boundaries loaded from POTA boundary data
- **Polygon with holes** - Properly renders parks that have excluded interior areas (e.g., private land within a national forest)
- **Fill opacity** - Semi-transparent fill to show underlying terrain
- **Boundary color** - Matches the POTA brand green

### Tap to View Park Details

Tap any park boundary polygon to open the park detail sheet showing:

- Park reference and name
- Your activation history at this park
- Top activators leaderboard
- Distance from your current location

### My Parks List

The map includes a **My Parks** layer showing all parks you've activated:

- **Filled polygons** for parks with successful activations (10+ QSOs)
- **Outlined polygons** for parks you've visited but haven't completed an activation
- **QSO count badges** on each park

Toggle this layer from the map layers menu.

## SOTA Summit Pins

SOTA summits appear as mountain-icon pins on the map:

- **Point value** displayed on the pin (1-10 based on altitude)
- **Color coding** - Green for unworked summits, gold for worked summits
- **Altitude label** shown on tap
- **Summit reference** (e.g., W7W/KG-001) in the callout

### Summit Lookup

Tap a SOTA pin to view:

- Summit name and reference
- Altitude and point value
- Your QSO history with this summit
- Recent activations from SOTAwatch

## WWFF References

WWFF nature reserve boundaries appear as a distinct map layer:

- **Green-bordered polygons** showing reserve boundaries
- **WWFF reference** (e.g., KFF-1234) in the callout
- **Activation status** - Worked vs unworked indicator

## Historic Trail Overlays

For parks and areas with historic trails (e.g., Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail):

- **Trail path** rendered as a dashed line overlay
- **Trail name** shown on long-press
- **Intersection with parks** highlighted where trails pass through POTA parks

## Grid Square Overlay

Toggle the Maidenhead grid square overlay to display grid boundaries on the map:

- **4-character grid squares** shown as a broad grid
- **6-character sub-squares** shown when zoomed in
- **Grid labels** at each cell center
- **Worked grids** highlighted with a fill color
- **Unworked grids** shown as outlines only

This overlay is useful for tracking grid square awards (VUCC, Grid Squares WAS) and planning operations to fill gaps.

## Map Statistics Overlay

A heads-up statistics panel displays key metrics for the visible contacts:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **QSO Count** | Total contacts displayed on the map |
| **Average Distance** | Mean distance from your station to all contacts |
| **Longest Distance** | Furthest contact ({{< term "DX" >}} record) |
| **States Worked** | Count of unique US states and Canadian provinces |
| **DXCC Entities** | Count of unique countries worked |
| **QSOs/hr Rate** | Average contact rate during the time span |
| **Time Span** | Date range of displayed contacts |

These statistics update in real time as you apply filters.

## Filtering

The map supports multi-dimensional filtering to focus on specific operating conditions.

### Date Range Filter

Set a start and end date to view contacts from a specific period. The filter defaults to your earliest {{< term "QSO" >}} date through the current date.

### Band Filter

Filter by amateur {{< term "band" >}} (e.g., 20m, 40m, 2m).

### Mode Filter

Restrict the map to contacts using a specific {{< term "mode" >}} ({{< term "SSB" >}}, {{< term "CW" >}}, {{< term "FT8" >}}, etc.).

### Park Filter

For {{< term "POTA" >}} activators, filter by park reference (e.g., US-0001) to display only contacts made during that activation.

### Confirmed Filter

Show only QSOs confirmed via {{< term "QRZ" >}} or {{< term "LoTW" >}}. The app displays the **union** of both confirmation sources.

### Active Filter Badges

All active filters are displayed as badges at the top of the map. Tap any badge to remove that filter.

## Individual QSO Toggle

The **Show Individual QSOs** toggle switches between two rendering modes:

### Grid Square Mode (Default)

Contacts are aggregated by grid square. A single marker represents all QSOs within that grid. The marker label shows the QSO count.

### Individual QSO Mode

Every contact is displayed as a small dot marker. Tapping a marker shows that specific QSO's details.

## Activation Maps

{{< term "POTA" >}} activations have dedicated map views accessible from the activation detail screen.

### RST-Based Contact Coloring

On activation maps, QSO markers are color-coded by signal report:

| Color | RST Range | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Green** | 59, 599 | Strong signals |
| **Yellow** | 57-58, 579-589 | Good signals |
| **Red** | <57, <579 | Weak signals |

### Accessing Activation Maps

1. Open the **POTA** tab
2. Tap an activation entry
3. Tap **View Map** in the activation detail view

## QSO Callouts

Tap any contact marker to see a detailed callout overlay with callsign, frequency, mode, RST, equipment, and solar conditions (for POTA activations).

## Rove Session Maps

Rove sessions display numbered park markers, a dashed route line connecting stops in chronological order, and QSO locations overlaid on the route.

## Session Map (MAP Command)

While logging an active session, type `MAP` to view a real-time map of your current QSOs. The map updates live as you log additional contacts and automatically zooms to fit all contacts.
