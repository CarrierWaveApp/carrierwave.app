Log Scanning is an experimental (alpha) feature that lets you scan handwritten paper logs with your iPhone camera and import QSOs using on-device Vision OCR.

{{< experimental "alpha" >}}

## How It Works

1. Point your camera at a page of your handwritten log
2. Carrier Wave uses on-device Vision OCR to recognize text
3. Recognized entries are parsed using the same quick entry parser as the Logger
4. Review the parsed QSOs and import them into your log

## Tips for Best Results

- Use good lighting and hold the camera steady
- Printed or clearly written entries work best
- Standard log formats (callsign, frequency, mode, time) are recognized automatically
- You can correct any mis-recognized entries before importing
